India is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations - the Indus Valley Civilization that flourished during the 3rd millennium BCE along the Indus River basin.
The country shares borders with six nations (Pakistan, Nepal, China, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Bangladesh) and is connected to Sri Lanka by a 40-mile stretch of water off its southeast coast.
